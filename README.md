# Concrete Crack Detection

## Project Description
This project focuses on developing a machine learning solution to detect cracks in concrete structures. By leveraging image classification techniques, the model categorizes concrete images into two classes: "With Cracks" and "Without Cracks". This AI-based approach aims to enhance building safety and durability by automating the crack detection process, reducing human errors, and enabling faster structural assessments.

The solution uses a publicly available dataset, applies transfer learning with pre-trained models and follows a complete machine learning workflow from problem definition to deployment.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is sourced from Mendeley and can be accessed at the following link: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2. It contains labeled concrete images categorized as cracked or non-cracked, facilitating model training and evaluation.

## Project Features
- Image Classification: Detects cracks in concrete structures.
- Crack Types: Covers hairline cracks, shrinkage cracks, settlement cracks and structural cracks.
- Model Optimization: Ensures high accuracy while preventing overfitting.
